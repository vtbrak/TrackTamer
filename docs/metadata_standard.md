# Track Tamer video metadata standard

**Schema 1 (draft, 2026-11-06).** The trial information that any app
recording videos for Track Tamer saves beside its videos, so Track Tamer can
fill it in automatically (ROADMAP §16). **Track Tamer owns this standard**:
apps that generate video follow it, and changes are made here first, then in
the apps. It stays a draft until the user says otherwise; while it's a draft,
changes don't raise `schema_version`. Track Tamer reads it, and adds its own
part to the same file (built 2026-11-11; section 1).

Apps covered so far: **Creature Capture**, **Boom Box** and **Pellet
Paparazzi** (see "Apps" at the end). Apps whose videos Track Tamer doesn't
analyze follow it too, where the fields apply, so every lab data file has
the same fields with the same names.

---

## 1. Files and names

For each trial, per arena, an app writes beside the videos:

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `<date>_<time>_<arena>_info.json` | the trial information (this standard). **The only file Track Tamer reads for trial information.** |
| one video per camera | named in `cameras[].video` |
| one `_frames.csv` per camera | the measured time of every frame, named in `cameras[].timestamps_csv` |
| a running log (optional), one row per trial | for people (a spreadsheet of every trial in an experiment); Track Tamer doesn't read it. Its columns are fixed (below) |

**No per-trial `_info.csv`** (user, 2026-11-11: the same details were being
saved several times over). The JSON is the one record of a trial; an app
that wants a spreadsheet for people keeps **a running log**, one row per
trial, and every app's log has **these columns, in this order, every time**.
A column is never left out: it's blank when the app has nothing for it.

`date`, `start_time`, `assay`, `assay_variant`, `phase`, `arena`,
`experimenter`, `cohort`, `animal_id`, `sex`, `strain`, `dob`, `treatment`,
`trial_day`, `session_number`, `notes`, `duration_set_min`,
`duration_actual_s`, `stopped_early`, `frames`, `repeated_frames`, `videos`,
`encoder`, `app_version`

- The names are the JSON's field names, and the values are the JSON's, with
  the same words in every app: `stopped_early` is `yes` or `no`;
  `repeated_frames` is `<camera label>:<count>` and `videos` is the video
  file names, each with several cameras separated by `;`; `frames` is the
  frames written (the first camera's); `encoder` is the video encoder.
- These are Creature Capture's log columns as it already wrote them.
  **No `room` and no `app_name` column** (user, 2026-11-11: not wanted;
  they stay in the JSON for an app that has them).
- Track Tamer's own tables use the same words. Its Summary row carries
  `animal_id` after File; the rest about the animal and the task is listed
  on its workbook's Experiment sheet.

**Track Tamer adds to the info file.** When it tracks or exports a video it
adds an object named `track_tamer` to that video's entry in `cameras`
(section 2), in the same file, and saves the file again whole. It never
changes anything the recording app wrote. So an app must not expect the
file to stay byte for byte as it wrote it, must not rewrite an info file
after the trial, and should ignore keys it doesn't know when reading one. A
video with no info file gets `<video name>_info.json` from Track Tamer, in
this layout, holding only Track Tamer's part.

**Name parts:**
- `<date>` is `YYYY-MM-DD`.
- `<time>` is the start time as `HH-MM-SS` (24-hour; dashes because `:`
  isn't allowed in Windows file names).
- `<arena>` and `<camera label>` use letters, digits and `-` only: **no
  spaces and no `_`**, so names can be split reliably.

Example: `2026-11-05_16-56-42_EPM1_info.json`.

**Videos** are named `<date>_<time>_<arena>_<camera label>.mp4`
(e.g. `2026-11-05_16-56-42_EPM1_Overhead.mp4`). Every video name must be
unique within its folder.

**How Track Tamer matches a video to its info file:** it reads every
`*_info.json` in the video's folder and picks the one whose `cameras[].video`
lists the video's exact file name. If a video was renamed, a name starting
with the info file's `<date>_<time>_<arena>_` still matches, after the user
confirms. So: write bare file names (no folders), exactly as on disk, and
keep videos and their info file together.

**Reserved endings.**
- For the apps: `_info.json`, `_frames.csv`, `_trials.csv`, `_log.csv`
  (and `_info.csv`, which older recordings have).
- For Track Tamer's own files (added to a video's name, so apps must not use
  them): `_LocationOutput.csv`, `_reference.png`, `_ObjectScoring.csv`,
  `_analysis.xlsx`, `_path.png`, `_heatmap.png`, `_tracked.mp4`,
  `_MotionIndex.csv`, `_trace.png`, `_aligned.png`.

Track Tamer skips `_frames.csv`, `_info.csv` and `_trials.csv` when a folder is
added.

---

## 2. How an info file is organized

Every info file has up to three kinds of fields:

| Kind | Where it goes | Who writes it |
|---|---|---|
| **Standard fields** (section 4) | top level, and in each `cameras` entry | every app, using only the ones it has (the required ones are a must) |
| **Assay fields** (section 5) | top level | only for that assay (e.g. `objects` only for Object Recognition) |
| **App fields** | inside one object named after the app, in lowercase with `_` (`creature_capture`, `startle_box`, …) | only that app |

An app writes **only the standard fields it has**: anything it doesn't know
is left out, never filled with blanks. Anything the standard doesn't cover
goes in the app's own object, never at the top level, so it can't clash
with a standard field added later or with another app's field of the same
name. Per-camera app fields go in an object of the same name inside that
camera's entry.

**Track Tamer's own object, `track_tamer`,** sits inside a video's `cameras`
entry (per-camera app fields go there), since its setup is per video:

| Key | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `version`, `saved` | the Track Tamer version and when it last tracked the video |
| `test` | the test the video was tracked as |
| `setup` | the session (start frame, end frame, length), crop, exclusion shapes, regions, scale points and length, objects and their types, typed stimulus frames; shapes in full-size video pixels, with the frame size they were drawn on |
| `tracking` | what the tracking file would otherwise repeat on every row: the video's name, every tracking setting, the scale, and the region outlines as tracked. For startle: the threshold, start frame, crop, frame rate, pixels analyzed, where the stimuli came from, and the stimulus frames if they were typed in (stimuli from the recording app are read from `stimuli`, not copied) |
| `analysis` | the analysis settings of the last export |
| `files` | the names of the files Track Tamer made beside the video (tracking file, reference image, workbook, plots) |

With it, a video added to Track Tamer again comes back with its setup as it
was and its tracking file attached, so plots can be made or the video
tracked again with the same regions and exclusions. The tracking file
itself (`_LocationOutput.csv`, or startle's `_MotionIndex.csv`) holds only
the per-frame columns.

Track Tamer reads the standard and assay fields, copies the app objects
into the export's Settings sheet as they are, and otherwise ignores them. If
a field in an app object turns out to be useful to Track Tamer or needed by
several apps, it's added to the standard (section 7) and apps move it to
the top level.

Example, from a Creature Capture Open Field trial:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "app_name": "Creature Capture",
  "app_version": "0.2.0",
  "date": "2026-11-05",
  "start_time": "16:56:42",
  "assay": "Open Field",
  "arena": "OF2",
  "animal_id": "M7",
  "treatment": "saline",
  "trial_day": 1,
  "session_number": 1,
  "duration_set_min": 60,
  "cameras": [
    {
      "label": "Overhead",
      "camera_position": "Camera5",
      "video": "2026-11-05_16-56-42_OF2_Overhead.mp4",
      "timestamps_csv": "2026-11-05_16-56-42_OF2_Overhead_frames.csv",
      "fps_measured": 9.84,
      "camera_settings": {"encoder": "libx264", "exposure": {"apply": true, "value": -5}}
    }
  ],
  "creature_capture": {"experiment": "Open Field 60 min", "gpu": false}
}
```

Here `assay`, `animal_id` and the rest are standard fields. There are no
assay fields, since Open Field has none. `experiment` and `gpu` are Creature
Capture's own fields, so they sit in its object.

---

## 3. Assay names, variants and phases

Three fields say what was run, each from a fixed list:
- **`assay`**: the test. Track Tamer uses it to pick its analysis.
- **`assay_variant`**: the version of that test, when the test has versions
  (e.g. which object task). Left out for tests without versions.
- **`phase`**: which session of the test this is, when the test has
  sessions.

Write each **exactly** as shown. Track Tamer's matching ignores upper/lower
case and spaces at the ends.

| `assay` | Track Tamer | `assay_variant` (one of) | `phase` (one of) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Elevated Plus Maze` | built | | |
| `Open Field` | built | | |
| `Object Recognition` | built | `Novel Object Recognition`, `Spatial Object Recognition` | `Habituation`, `Training`, `Test` |
| `Acoustic Startle Response` | planned (ROADMAP §13) | `Prepulse Inhibition`, `Startle Habituation` | |
| `Conditioned Place Preference` | planned | | `Pretest`, `Conditioning`, `Test` |
| `Puzzle Box` | not analyzed in Track Tamer for now (listed for consistency) | | |
| `Skilled Reaching` | not analyzed in Track Tamer (listed for consistency) | | |

Variants of one assay share Track Tamer's analysis: an object trial is
analyzed the same way whichever variant it is (the user marks each object
Familiar, Novel or Moved when drawing it). The variant is recorded in the
Summary, so trials can be told apart, which matters in Habituation and
Training, when every object is familiar.

New assays, variants and phases are added to this table as Track Tamer
analyzes them, or when a lab app records them (so the names stay the same
everywhere), even if Track Tamer never analyzes them. An app may record an
assay that isn't listed (e.g. a pilot); Track Tamer then asks the user to
choose the test.

---

## 4. Standard fields

JSON, UTF-8. **Required:** `schema_version`, `assay`, `animal_id`, and
`cameras`, with each camera's `video`, `camera_position` and
`camera_settings`. Everything else is optional but used when present.
Leave a field out when it's unknown or empty; don't write `""` or `null`.
Numbers are JSON numbers; yes/no values are `true`/`false`. Frames are
counted from **0**, the same as the frames in the video file.

### Trial and animal
| Field | Type | What it is | Track Tamer uses it to |
|---|---|---|---|
| `schema_version` | number | `1` | read the file correctly |
| `app_name`, `app_version` | text | the app that wrote it | Settings sheet |
| `date` | `YYYY-MM-DD` | trial date, from the recording computer's clock | Summary column |
| `start_time` | `HH:MM:SS` | start time, from the recording computer's clock | Summary column |
| `assay` | text | from section 3 | **set the test type** |
| `assay_variant` | text | from section 3's list for that assay (left out if it has none) | Summary column |
| `phase` | text | from section 3's list for that assay | Summary column; Object Recognition phase |
| `arena` | text | arena name (as in the file name) | Summary column; draft crop, scale and regions from that arena's last video |
| `room` | text | room or rig | Summary column |
| `experimenter` | text | who ran it | Summary column |
| `cohort` | text | **Cohort / litter** (label it that way on screen; the field name stays `cohort`) | Summary column |
| `animal_id` | text | animal ID | **Summary column** |
| `sex` | text | `F`, `M`, or `U` (unknown or not recorded) | Summary column |
| `strain` | text | strain or genotype | Summary column |
| `dob` | `YYYY-MM-DD` | date of birth | age on the test day |
| `treatment` | text | treatment or group (a blinded code is fine) | **Summary column for comparing groups** |
| `trial_day` | number | day of a multi-day trial (1, 2, …) | Summary column; Object Recognition trial day |
| `session_number` | number | which session that day, when there's more than one in a day (1, 2, …) | Summary column |
| `notes` | text | | export |
| `duration_set_min` | number | length chosen, in minutes | **set the session length** |
| `duration_actual_s` | number | length actually recorded, in seconds | warn if shorter than the session length |
| `stopped_early` | true/false | | warn |

### `cameras`: one entry per camera in this arena
| Field | Type | What it is | Track Tamer uses it to |
|---|---|---|---|
| `label` | text | camera label (as in the video name) | Settings sheet |
| `camera_position` | text | where the camera is (the app's camera position or slot, e.g. `Camera5`) | Settings sheet |
| `camera_settings` | object | **every** setting used, whether changed or not, including the video `encoder` (e.g. `{"encoder": "libx264", "exposure": {"apply": true, "value": -5}, …}`) | Settings sheet |
| `video` | text | the video's file name | **match the video** |
| `timestamps_csv` | text | its `_frames.csv` file name | **the frame times (the record of timing)** |
| `fps_set` | number | frame rate asked for | Settings sheet |
| `fps_measured` | number | frames ÷ recorded seconds, from the frame times | check |
| `width_px`, `height_px` | number | frame size | check |
| `frames` | number | frames written (including repeats) | check the video is complete |
| `verified_frames_in_file` | number | frames counted in the finished file | check (should equal `frames`) |
| `repeated_frames` | number | frames repeated to keep timing | Summary column |
| `repeated_frame_indices` | list of numbers | which frames, from 0 | kept for timing, left out of speed peaks |
| `error` | text | error message (left out if none) | warn |

### `_frames.csv`
One row per video frame: `frame` (from 0), `video_time_s`, `repeated`
(`true`/`false`), and any of the app's own timing columns (e.g.
`tick_time_s`, `camera_frame_time_s`, `camera_frame_seq`).

**These measured times are the record of timing.** Track Tamer takes each
frame's time from `video_time_s`, and uses `fps_measured` and the video
file's own frame rate only as checks (or when there's no `_frames.csv`).

---

## 5. Assay fields

Written only for those assays.

### Object Recognition
| Field | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `objects` | list | one entry per object: `name`, `identity` (what it is, e.g. `glass bottle`), `kind` (`Familiar`, `Novel` or `Moved`), `position` (e.g. `top left`) |

`name` must be `object 1`, `object 2`, … in order: those are the names
Track Tamer gives the objects, so each object's type can be matched. Track
Tamer sets each object's type; the user draws the circles.

### Acoustic Startle Response
`stimuli`: one entry per trial that took place, in order.

| Field | Type | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| `frame` | number | video frame at the event time, from 0 (required) |
| `video_time_s` | number | event time, seconds from frame 0. Track Tamer's windows use this when present |
| `type` | text | `pulse`, `prepulse+pulse`, `prepulse` or `none` |
| `pulse_db`, `prepulse_db` | number | levels in dB SPL (absolute, not above background) |
| `interval_ms` | number | prepulse onset to pulse onset (`prepulse+pulse` only) |
| `pulse_freq_hz` | number | tone frequency; left out for noise |
| `pulse_stimulus` | text | `tone` or `noise` |

For `prepulse+pulse` the event time is the **pulse**; the prepulse started
`interval_ms` earlier. Track Tamer's startle window starts at the event time.
Its baseline window ends at the event time, or at the prepulse onset on
`prepulse+pulse` trials.

### Conditioned Place Preference (planned)
To be added when its analysis is built (e.g. which chamber was paired with
the drug, the conditioning session number, and the chamber the animal was
confined to in a conditioning session).

---

## 6. General rules

- Write the JSON in one go when recording stops (write to a temporary name,
  then rename), so a crash never leaves half a file.
- These files hold animal information: they're research data and stay off
  GitHub, like the videos. (This standard itself is fine to share.)

---

## 7. Changing the standard

- Track Tamer owns this file. Changes are agreed here, then made in the apps.
- While the standard is a draft, changes don't raise `schema_version`.
- After that: **adding** an optional field doesn't change `schema_version`;
  **renaming, removing, or changing the meaning** of a field raises it by 1,
  and Track Tamer keeps reading every earlier version.

### Changes
- **Schema 1 (draft, 2026-11-06):** first version, built from Creature
  Capture's `_info.json`. Revised the same day: assay, variant and phase
  each from a fixed list per assay (`Object Recognition` with variants
  `Novel Object Recognition` and `Spatial Object Recognition`; `Acoustic
  Startle Response` with `Prepulse Inhibition` and `Startle Habituation`);
  `phase` made a standard field with a
  list per assay; `start_wall_clock` removed (date and start time come from
  the recording computer's clock); `session_number` added (sessions within
  a day; `trial_day` is the day of a multi-day trial); `sex` may be `U`;
  `slot` renamed `camera_position`, and it and `camera_settings` (now
  including `encoder`) became required standard camera fields; the frame
  times in `_frames.csv` are the record of timing; Track Tamer reads only
  the JSON. Then removed (not recorded in the lab): `weight_g`, `cage`,
  `ear_tag`, dose fields, `arena_size_cm`,
  `environment`; `cohort` is labeled "Cohort / litter".
- **Schema 1 (draft, 2026-11-09):** startle `stimuli` settled from Boom Box
  1.1, with `pulse_freq_hz` and `pulse_stimulus` added.
- **Schema 1 (draft, 2026-11-10):** `Fear Conditioning` removed from the
  assay list (user: it won't be captured). An info file that still says it
  is treated like any assay not on the list.
- **Schema 1 (draft, 2026-11-10):** `Puzzle Box` added to the assay list
  (user). It has trial days and several sessions on each day, so its files
  carry `trial_day` and `session_number`; no variant or phase.

---

## Apps

### Creature Capture
Writes `<date>_<time>_<arena>_info.json` per arena per trial, one MP4 and
one `_frames.csv` per camera, and a row in its running log
(`<folder>_log.csv`). Up to 0.2.0 it also wrote a per-trial `_info.csv`;
it was asked to stop on 2026-11-11 (section 1).

**Matches the revised schema 1 draft** (reported by Creature Capture,
2026-11-06; committed and pushed, confirmed 2026-11-10). Its `fps_measured`
is measured from the recording clock: (frames - 1) / (last tick - first
tick). Its assay list is the section 3 list without `Skilled Reaching`,
plus Other. For `Puzzle Box` it writes arena `PuzzleBox` and camera
`Overhead`, with `trial_day` and `session_number`:
- `schema_version`, `app_name`, `app_version`; `date` and `start_time` from
  the recording computer (no `start_wall_clock`).
- `assay`, `assay_variant` and `phase` from each assay's own lists in
  section 3, shown on its Record tab only when the assay has them; values
  outside a list are dropped.
- `trial_day` and `session_number`; `sex` F, M or U; `cohort` labeled
  "Cohort / litter"; numbers and `true`/`false` types; blank fields left out.
- Arena names and camera labels use letters, digits and `-` only (the
  editor enforces it, and output is cleaned); videos named
  `<date>_<time>_<arena>_<camera label>.mp4`.
- Each camera: `camera_position` and `camera_settings` (the `encoder` and
  every control, defaults filled in), `fps_set`, `fps_measured`,
  `width_px`, `height_px`, numeric `repeated_frames`, frames counted from 0,
  `error` left out when empty.
- `objects` for object trials. The `creature_capture` object holds only
  `experiment` and `gpu`.
- None of the fields left out of the standard (weight, cage, ear tag, dose,
  arena size, environment).
- The JSON is written in one go.

Creature Capture keeps a copy of this file
(`Creature_Capture/docs/metadata_standard.md`; its program files are in
`app/` and its documents in `docs/`, as here), taken from GitHub; refresh it
from GitHub whenever the standard changes.

### Boom Box
Acoustic startle recording. `assay` = `Acoustic Startle Response` (variants
`Prepulse Inhibition`, `Startle Habituation`); arena `ASR1`, camera label
`Side`. App-only fields in `boom_box`. Its full data guide is
`app/docs/TRACK_TAMER_DATA.md` in its repository
(github.com/vtbrak/BoomBox), describing Boom Box 1.3.4 (reported by Boom Box,
2026-11-11; still schema 1, nothing removed or renamed since 1.3.3).

**Matches schema 1 (draft).** What Track Tamer needs to know from the guide:
- **Stimuli.** Since Boom Box 1.2 each `stimuli` entry with a pulse carries
  `pulse_stimulus` (`tone` or `noise`) and `pulse_freq_hz` (left out for
  noise). Sessions recorded with 1.1 don't; Track Tamer then reads them from
  `boom_box.trials`, which lines up with `stimuli` by position. `type` is
  `pulse`, `prepulse+pulse`, `prepulse` or `none` (a scheduled time with no
  sound: a baseline for comparison).
- **A session folder with no `_info.json` is a failed recording** (since
  1.3.2: the video encoder failed, so there is no usable video; any partial
  video is left as `_video.mp4`). Skip such folders.
- **Text files are UTF-8** on Mac and Windows (since 1.3.2).
- **Built-in protocols** (`boom_box.protocol_name`), each starting with a
  5-minute habituation in 65 dB background noise, and how their results are
  meant to be grouped:

  | Protocol | `assay_variant` | Group results by |
  |---|---|---|
  | `Tone Volume Sensitivity` (was `ASR Standard`): 15 tones at 105 dB, 4 to 20 kHz | left out | `pulse_freq_hz` |
  | `Startle Habituation`: 100 tones at 8 kHz, 115 dB | `Startle Habituation` | stimulus order |
  | `Hearing Test`: 36 tones at 8 kHz, 40 to 120 dB, played in silence | left out | `pulse_db` |
  | `I/O` (since 1.3.4): 40 ms white-noise bursts at 70, 80, 90, 100, 110 and 120 dB plus a no-stimulus trial, in 5 shuffled blocks (35 trials), one every 15 s from 300 s | left out | `pulse_db`, with the no-stimulus trials as the baseline |
  | `PPI Default` and other PPI protocols | `Prepulse Inhibition` | `type`, `prepulse_db`, `interval_ms` |

  Levels can differ from stimulus to stimulus, so read `pulse_db` from each
  one. **Track Tamer today** reports startle per trial type and per pulse
  frequency, prepulse inhibition per prepulse level and interval, and
  habituation by trial order; **it doesn't yet group by pulse level**
  (`pulse_db`), which Hearing Test and I/O sessions need (not built; the
  level is in the Trials table for each trial).

  In an `I/O` session Boom Box's own trial types are `startle` and
  `no_stim`. In `stimuli` a startle trial is `type` `pulse` with
  `pulse_stimulus` `noise` (so no `pulse_freq_hz`), and a no-stimulus trial
  is `type` `none` with no pulse fields (checked in Boom Box's guide and
  code, 2026-11-11), so `stimuli` still lines up with `boom_box.trials` by
  position.
- **Where a protocol comes from** (since 1.3.4): `boom_box.protocol_reference`
  is text, or `null` when none was given: the paper or procedure the
  protocol's design comes from, as DOI or web links. Several are separated
  by `; `, each followed by a short note in brackets, e.g.
  `https://doi.org/10.3389/fnint.2013.00103 (habituation design);
  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jneumeth.2025.110497 (choice of the 8 kHz tone
  at 115 dB)`. Track Tamer doesn't read it yet (it could go on the exported
  Settings sheet; not built).
- **Mac recordings made before 1.3.4 at 1280x720 really ran at 10 fps.** The
  video is still 30 frames per second at an even rate, with about 2 of every
  3 frames a repeat: `repeated_frames` is about two-thirds of `frames`, and
  `_frames.csv` marks each repeat. Times and stimulus frames are still
  right. From 1.3.4 Mac capture runs at the full rate (a 30 fps test had no
  repeats). **Track Tamer today** leaves repeated frames out when it looks
  for a startle peak and notes how many it left out on each trial, so these
  sessions are read correctly, but a 200 ms window then holds only about 2
  real frames, so the peak and reaction time are coarse. The Summary
  counts them (`RepeatedFrames`), and **Analyze warns when more than half of
  a video's frames are repeats**, with the share and the real frames a
  second (built 2026-11-11).
- **From 1.3.5 (reported 2026-11-11; built, not yet committed there):** no
  per-session `_info.csv` (up to 1.3.4 it wrote one, with columns that
  varied and other words than Creature Capture's). A running log instead,
  `<data folder>_log.csv` (by default `Data/Data_log.csv`), with section
  1's 24 columns and words. It writes `_info.json` once and never rewrites
  it, so Track Tamer's `track_tamer` object is safe there.
- **Tested on the lab's equipment** (user, 2026-11-11): the app runs and
  captures video there. **Not yet run with mice.**

### Pellet Paparazzi
Skilled reaching recording. **Not analyzed in Track Tamer** (the task and
its analysis are different); it follows this standard where the fields
apply, so its data files match the rest of the lab's. `assay` =
`Skilled Reaching`. App-only fields in `pellet_paparazzi`. Its fields will
be listed here once its info file is written.

<!-- Add a section here for each new app as it's brought in. -->
